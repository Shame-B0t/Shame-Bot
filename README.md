## Project Description
*People like to work in groups, but groups can be distracting. Enter Shame-b0t, your personal productivity manager (with attitude).*

---

When Shame-b0t is added to a Discord server, you can use it to monitor or restrict your activities in three different ways:

1) **Shame**

	`--focus shame HH:MM`

	Shame mode will not bar you from any channels... but if Shame-b0t catches you talking anywhere in the monitored server, you will be **called out** in public for not focusing.

2) **Isolation**
	
	`--focus isolation HH:MM`

	Isolation mode will create a new, private channel where you can give the bot commands; you will be **locked out** of all other channels the bot has access to in the server during the specified time.

3) **Lockdown**

	`--focus lockdown HH:MM`

	The same as `isolation`, but you will be **unable to exit early** without first completing a typing challenge.
	
	The challenge can be viewed by typing `--exit` in your lockdown channel, and can be completed by sending a message that begins with `--challenge` followed by the specified number of words.

---

**Exit** with `--exit`

Check the **time remaining** with `--time`

Activate a **countdown** with `--countdown`

---

**Away Messages**

If another user in the server mentions you while you're supposed to be focusing, they will be sent an automatic reply notifying them that you are unavailable.

---

*(Time is a duration in hours and minutes, such as 01:30 for one hour and 30 minutes)*

---

Shame-b0t should be assigned the highest spot in the role hierarchy of your server in order to be able to manipulate channels and roles in a reliable way.

Project planning can be seen on our [Miro board](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_lJdRu3A=/).

When Shame-b0t is ready to be released into the wild, you'll find a link here!

Have a productive day!
